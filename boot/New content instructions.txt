1. when any usb camera insert air unit if it can start as TX mode that mean raspberry PI support this camera,If the camera does not display properly, please modify the "USBCAM=" parameter line.
2. Using the IP camera need to modify the IPCAM = command line make sure the IP address consistent with IP camera's actual address (unnecessary modifying the IP camera) if the camera cannot display normally,refer to the attached to modify the configuration file in IPCAM = parameter. Automatic identification of IP camera will take up the startup time, if you don't use the IP camera or the ground unit using ETHERNET_HOTSPOT=Y can commenting IPCAM = command line in the configuration file.
3. When set STREAM=rawsock, traditional RAWSOCK mode will be used for video transmission; when set STREAM=svpcom, SVPCOM mode will be used for video transmission. All types of cameras can use two video transmission modes.When using Pi Zero/W and Atheros/ Ralink chip wifi CARDS as air units, the CSI interface camera alone should set STREAM=rawsock or VIDEO_BITRATE=4096.
4. When the ground Pi CPU temperature is above 55°C, the GPIO25(PIN22) will pull high level (3.3V), which can be used to start the fan.
5. When only connected to a PC or Android/IOS ground station application as a display, you can set OSD=N to disable OSD to reduce startup time. 
6. Set RC=sumd/ibus/srxl/mavlink/msp using RTS feames (ar7010/ar9271/rtl8812au/rtl8811au).Set RC=disabled using DATA feames when using a card that does not support RTS feames (Ralink series or RTL8814AU).
7. RTL8812au and RTL8814AU support STBC and LDPC Set STBC_LDPC=Y enable,RTL8811AU does not support STBC Set STBC_LDPC=N.Ralink series and Atheros cards Set STBC_LDPC=N.
8. Enable RC function air/ground unit should use at least one pair of the same wifi card, support RC function wifi card including:Atheros ar9271/ar7010 or Realtek rtl8812au/rtl8811au card.
9. If the ground unit uses several wifi cards at the same time and the transmitting ability is inconsistent (depending on the transmitting power of the wifi card and the matched antenna gain, etc.), the card with the strongest transmitting ability should be specified for RC function; otherwise, it will be automatically selected according to RSSI signal strength.Specifying one card for RC requires uncommenting the #RC_NIC=*********** command line and modifying the * to the card's actual MAC address (Numbers and letters are consecutive, no Spaces or other delimiters, all used lowercase).
10. When using IP/USB camera and CSI interface camera at the same time, HDMI on the ground unit only output a camera's video.and forwarding dual videos via VIDEO_UDP_PORT and VIDEO_UDP_PORT2.QGC for Android or FPV_VR can switch video sources by modifying ports.
11. Using the double card double frequency  to TX,  multi card  ground  RX, you can set the TXMODE = auto automatic setting transmitting and receiving card MAC address and the corresponding frequency point, ar9271 card does not support a binary mode, support double mode, including not limited to rtl8812au, rt3070, rt8192, rt3572, rt5572, mt7612u.
12. LINK_RC_KEY=** Set RC and uplink ID,the value range (0-99).Only ground units with the same ID as an air unit can uplink and RC.
13. TELEMETRY_OSD=** Setup OSD protocol (setup protocol is no longer required in osdconfig.txt file).
14. txpower =** Set transmission power, range 1~63, valid for all types of CARDS.
15. VIDEO_BITRATE=** When set to auto, use automatic transmission bandwidth measurement and automatic camera bitrate percentage. The bitrate percentage is calculated according to the FEC value.Automatic bandwidth measurement is used when the value is set to less than 100 number  the bitrate percentage is set to this number(for example, VIDEO_BITRATE=70, 70% transmission bandwidth is used as the camera bitrate).The camera bitrate set to this number when the value is set to greater than 100 number and disable automatic bandwidth measurement.(for example,VIDEO_BITRATE=4096, using a fixed bitrate of 4MB /s).
16. During the auto sync process of config files, the air unit obtains the config files currently of the ground unit (Selected by ground unit GPIO23/PIN 16,GPIO24/PIN 18 status) and compares them. If they are inconsistent, the air unit config file (Selected by air unit GPIO23/PIN 16,GPIO24/PIN 18 status) will be overwritten and restarted.
17. When useing the config file auto sync,the SSID definitionthe in the apconfig.txt of the air unit and the ground unit must be kept consistent. The default setting  no password. When the password is enabled, config sync will be disabled.When multigroup air and ground units are used simultaneously, sync can be distinguished by modifying the SSID and channel.
18. When both the external telemetry(TELEMETRY_TRANSMISSION=external) and the ground telemetry output(ENABLE_SERIAL_TELEMETRY_OUTPUT=Y) are enabled, if uplink is disabled(TELEMETRY_UPLINK=disabled), the telemetry device(lora、LRS or 3DR dongles via RX PIN) and antenna tracking device (via TX PIN) can be connected to the same serial port.
